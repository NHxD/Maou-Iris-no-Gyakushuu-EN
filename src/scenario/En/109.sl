[Sonia]「So... This is my room.」

@move_f f=iris@bisyo in=r t=300

[Elise]「... Is it? What a luxurious room! Although it pales in comparison to my demon castle... You know, the one destroyed by the Hero.」

[Elise]「Well, you said the reason that you were attacked was because of a dispute over succession rights. Then which place are you in for the inheritance?」

@bs f=sonia@yowaki

[Sonia]「Well... At the moment, I'm in first place.」

[Elise]「... Uh. Even though you have two older brothers, you're still in first place... Interesting...」

@bs f=sonia@yowaki_hoho

[Sonia]「But that's only for the time being. I used to be last... However, as soon as I became engaged to the Hero, I suddenly got first place!」

@bs f=iris@reisyo

[Elise]「Hah! You and the Hero Chiot. Well, I don't have any interest in the love affair of you humans.」

@bs f=iris@bisyo

[Elise]「However, why did you become the favorite to inherit the throne only after your engagement to the Hero?」

@bs f=sonia@bisyo

[Sonia]「Ah... Well... My late father, the King, wanted me to marry Chiot so that he would become the next king.」

@bs f=sonia@bisyo_hoho

[Sonia]「In our country, succession rights can be transferred to the one you marry.」
[Sonia]「And since the Hero would be a very good king, it's a delightful choice for me too.」

[Elise] (... So that's the reason. That's the only reason why Sonia was chosen then.)

@bs f=sonia@tameiki_hoho

[Sonia]「However, after the sudden passing of my father, the dispute over the right to the throne started and I was immediately ambushed by the bandits.」

@bs f=iris@reisyo

[Elise]「Well... Let it be a valuable life experience for you...」
[Elise]「The weak in the world can only be controlled by the strong, and they have no freedom. Strength is everything.」

@bs f=sonia@yowaki_hoho

[Sonia]「Waah～ But, but... The people would never follow a leader who rule only with power...」
[Sonia]「The Chiot I met, not only has great strength, but he's also a gentle and capable person.」

[Elise]「And how can this boring gentle emotional fool protect you?」
[Elise]「Tell me where is your Hero now, uh? You're only a puppet whose strings are being pulled by the Devil.」

@bs f=sonia@odoroki

[Sonia]「How come―?!」

@bs f=iris@bisyo

[Elise]「Or... Can you disobey my orders by being gentle? If you can manage to do that, then I'd be very impressed.」

;; for some time

@bs f=iris@bisyo

[Elise]「... Well, bullying you is fun but meaningless so I will stop...for now, at least. Besides, I have a country waiting for me to rule over.」

;;26: Iris thinking about finding a royal family who was trying to rob the princess of the throne

@bs f=iris@kuyasii

[Elise]「All right, I have something to ask you. Do you have any idea who could have ordered the hit on you?」

;[Elise]「...」
[Sonia]「...」

@bs f=iris@kanasimi

[Elise]「You know something, am I right? ... For example, that Prince Ey―」

[Sonia]「This...」

@bs f=iris@kuyasii

[Elise]「Tsk... Although I can compel you to tell me everything by using another curse spell...」
[Elise]「This directly concerns your own life. So let's cooperate, all right?」

@bs f=sonia@tameiki

[Sonia]「... Well, brother Eyster loudly rejected the idea of the Hero becoming the next king.」

@bs f=iris@bisyo

[Elise]「Well, for obvious reasons... Anything else?」

@bs f=sonia@yowaki_hoho

[Sonia]「Then there isn't any suspicious person... And... To doubt my own brother is just too―」

@bs f=iris@kanasimi

[Elise]「You're just too naive, Sonia. Well, never mind. Let's find evidence to corroborate my suspicion.」

@bs f=iris@kuyasii

[Elise] (My first intention was to brainwash all the royal family as soon as I entered the castle...)
[Elise] (However, the sacred barrier set up by the high priest got in the way, so now I have to achieve my goal in another way somehow...)

[Elise] (Thus I must find evidence on who wants to murder the princess and expose their identity to everyone.)

[Elise] (For that, I must keep a low profile and investigate in secrecy...)
